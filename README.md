# Overview

The EOS Plugin for Unity brings the free services from Epic that connect players across all platforms and all stores to Unity in an easy-to-use package. Find more information on what services Epic Online Services encompasses at [https://dev.epicgames.com/en-US/services](https://dev.epicgames.com/en-US/services) and read the developer documentation at [https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/epic-online-services](https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/epic-online-services).

This repository contains the source code for development of the [EOS Plugin for Unity (UPM Package)](https://github.com/EOS-Contrib/eos_plugin_for_unity_upm).

Out of the box, this project demonstrates (through a collection of sample scenes) each feature of the Epic Online Services SDK[^1]. The sample scenes (coupled with accompanying documentation) can be used to get an idea of how you can implement the online features you want in your game.

See [this](/com.playeveryware.eos/Documentation~/plugin_advantages.md) for a more complete overview of the advantages of using EOS with Unity.

[^1]: See the [supported-eos-sdk-features](#supported-eos-sdk-features) section for which SDK features specifically are demonstrated.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are **not** interested in the _development_ of the EOS Plugin for Unity project (and instead just want to get to using it) you can follow our guide on [Importing the Plugin Package](#importing-the-plugin-package) to start using the most recently released version of the EOS Plugin for Unity.

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

* [An Epic Games account](https://www.epicgames.com/id/register) (_although, most [features](#exploring-supported-eos-features) do not require your users to have an Epic Games account, you must have one to configure your game in the Epic Games Developer Portal_).
* A product configured on the [Epic Games Developer Portal](https://dev.epicgames.com/portal/).
* A Unity project to integrate the plugin into.

> [!NOTE]
> Your system should also satisfy [Unity's system requirements](https://docs.unity3d.com/2021.3/Documentation/Manual/system-requirements.html) as well as the [EOS system requirements](https://dev.epicgames.com/docs/epic-online-services/eos-get-started/system-requirements)

# Supported EOS SDK Features

Below is a table summarizing the features the EOS Plugin for Unity supports. Most features are demonstrated via sample scenes provided in the project, and links to the guide for each corresponding sample scene are listed below. In some cases (such as Anti-Cheat) the feature is not able to be demonstrated well with a scene. In those cases, a link to information about how the plugin utilizes the feature is provided. In some cases (such as logging and overlay) the features are not implemented in any one scene specifically, but in all of them.

Use the "Select Demo Scene" dropdown in the application to select the sample scene that corresponds with the walkthrough. 

There are many EOS features that do not require your player to have an Epic Games account - such features are also marked accordingly in the following table.

Efforts will be made to add corresponding support to features as they are added to the Epic Online Services SDK. The table above reflects the features as of December 2025.

[^2]: As of EOS SDK 1.18.1.2, only the Store Overlay is supported on mobile. The Social Overlay isn't supported. 

The mobile Epic Games Store is currently in closed beta. We’re excited to launch our self-publishing tools in the near future.

## Importing the Plugin Package

There are two options to install the package:

* From a [git url](/com.playeveryware.eos/Documentation~/add_plugin.md#adding-the-package-from-a-git-url) _(this method has the possible advantage of keeping the plugin up-to-date, if that's something that you would prefer)_.

Once imported into your project, be sure to [Configure the Plugin](/com.playeveryware.eos/Documentation~/configure_plugin.md) to work with your game.
