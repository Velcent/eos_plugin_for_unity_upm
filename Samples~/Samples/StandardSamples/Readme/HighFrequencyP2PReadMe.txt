High Frequency Peer 2 Peer Epic Online Services Demo

In this scene, you can assign values for Peer-to-Peer settings such as Package Size and SetRefreshRate.

This demo showcases the high-frequency Peer-to-Peer capabilities of the EOS Plugin for Unity by sharing mouse click positions between connected users with visual feedback.

How to use:
    1. Select a login type
    
    2. Once logged in on two instances, select a user from the friends list and click the Chat button to establish a connection. After that, any clicks on the screen will be visually shared as particle effects with the other connected user.

    3. Once you have 2 instances running you should be able to click the chat button on either one to connect and start clicking on the screen. The connected user will see particle effects at the same positions in real time.
