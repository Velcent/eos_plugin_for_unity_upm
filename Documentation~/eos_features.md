# Supported EOS SDK Features

Below is a table summarizing the features the EOS Plugin for Unity supports. Most features are demonstrated via sample scenes provided in the project, and links to the guide for each corresponding sample scene are listed below. In some cases (such as Anti-Cheat) the feature is not able to be demonstrated well with a scene. In those cases, a link to information about how the plugin utilizes the feature is provided. In some cases (such as logging and overlay) the features are not implemented in any one scene specifically, but in all of them.

Use the "Select Demo Scene" dropdown in the application to select the sample scene that corresponds with the walkthrough. 

There are many EOS features that do not require your player to have an Epic Games account - such features are also marked accordingly in the following table.

Efforts will be made to add corresponding support to features as they are added to the Epic Online Services SDK. The table above reflects the features as of December 2025.

[^2]: As of EOS SDK 1.18.1.2, only the Store Overlay is supported on mobile. The Social Overlay isn't supported. The mobile Epic Games Store is currently in closed beta. We’re excited to launch our self-publishing tools in the near future.
